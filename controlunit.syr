TIMING REPORT

NOTE: THESE TIMING NUMBERS ARE ONLY A SYNTHESIS ESTIMATE.
      FOR ACCURATE TIMING INFORMATION PLEASE REFER TO THE TRACE REPORT
      GENERATED AFTER PLACE-and-ROUTE.

Clock Information:
------------------
-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------+-------+
Clock Signal                                   | Clock buffer(FF name)   | Load  |

(*) This 1 clock signal(s) are generated by combinatorial logic,
and XST is not able to identify which are the primary clock signals.
Please use the CLOCK_SIGNAL constraint to specify the clock signal(s) generated by combinatorial logic.
INFO:Xst:2169 - HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
